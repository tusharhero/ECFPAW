* Things I want to add
** TODO language support for python using eglot
- [X] setup eglot
- [ ] make abstraction for running the code so that its language agnostic
* IMPORTANT PROGRAMS TO LOAD FIRST
** Package Manager
I am going to use [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][Elapaca]] package manager.

* GENERAL KEYBINDINGS
I will use general package to create all the keybindings for ECFPAW. I
only make key binds for the stuff I really need(That goes for the
configuration in general as well).

* ALL THE ICONS 
This is an icon set that can be used with dashboard, dired, ibuffer and other Emacs programs.
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package all-the-icons
    :ensure t
    :if (display-graphic-p))

  (use-package all-the-icons-dired
    :hook (dired-mode . (lambda () (all-the-icons-dired-mode t))))
#+end_src

* COMPANY
[[https://company-mode.github.io/][Company]] is a text completion framework for Emacs. The name stands for
"complete anything".  Completion will start automatically after you
type a few letters. Use M-n and M-p to select, <return> to complete or
<tab> to complete the common part.

#+begin_quote
Company was giving me troubles, removing all the customization, I
blindly copied from DistroTube worked. Lesson learned.
#+end_quote
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :defer 2
    :init
    (global-company-mode t))

  (use-package
    company-box
    :after company
    :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))


#+end_src
* DASHBOARD
[[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][emacs-dashboard]] is an package which allows you to make a nice little
dashboard which comes up when you start Emacs.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package dashboard
    :ensure t 
    :init
    (setq initial-buffer-choice 'dashboard-open)
    (setq dashboard-set-heading-icons t)
    (setq dashboard-set-file-icons t)
    (setq dashboard-startup-banner (get-user-config-file-path "images/trancendent-gnu.png"))
    (setq dashboard-banner-logo-title "ECFPAW")
    (setq dashboard-center-content t)
    (setq dashboard-items '((recents . 5)
                            (projects . 5)))
    :config
    (dashboard-setup-startup-hook))
#+end_src
* DIRED
Dired is a file manager within Emacs. It comes builtin.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; disable overloading with info by default, shift+( to show details
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-hide-details-mode)
  (use-package peep-dired
    :after dired
    :hook (evil-normalize-keymaps . peep-dired-hook)
    :config
    (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map (kbd "h") 'dired-up-directory)
    ;; use dired-find-file instead if not using dired-open package
    (evil-define-key 'normal dired-mode-map (kbd "l") 'dired-open-file) 
    (evil-define-key 'normal peep-dired-mode-map (kbd "j") 'peep-dired-next-file)
    (evil-define-key 'normal peep-dired-mode-map (kbd "k") 'peep-dired-prev-file))
#+end_src
* FONTS
** setting the fonts face
Defining the various fonts emacs will use.
#+begin_src elisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil
                      :font "FiraCode Nerd Font"
                      :height 130
                      :weight 'medium)
  (set-face-attribute 'font-lock-comment-face nil
                      :slant 'italic)
  (set-face-attribute 'font-lock-keyword-face nil
                      :slant 'italic)
  ;; Uncomment theh following line if line spacing needs adjusting.
  ;; (setq-default line-spacing 0.12)
#+end_src
** Zooming In/Out
For =CTRL=/-= zooming shortcuts.
#+begin_src elisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-=") 'text-scale-increase)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C--") 'text-scale-decrease)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<C-wheel-up>") 'text-scale-increase)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<C-wheel-down>") 'text-scale-decrease)
#+end_src
* GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE TWEAKS
Let's make GNU Emacs look a little better.

Mostly just disabling some Emacs features which are for beginners(mostly).
** Disable Menu bar and Toolbars 
Just too distracting.
#+begin_src elisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

** Display Line Numbers and Truncated Lines
I like relative line numbers(They help in Evil keybindings).
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
  (global-visual-line-mode t)
#+end_src
** Disable the scroll bar
Because they are totally unnecessary and I don't use them. Even if I
ever wanted to use my mouse, I would just use my mouse wheel instead
of this.
#+begin_src elisp
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src
* MODE LINE
[[https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline/][spaceline]] is the mode-line package extracted from Spacemacs. Decided to
use it because my mode-line was getting too long.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package spaceline
    :config (spaceline-emacs-theme))
#+end_src
* HELM
[[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm][helm]] is a completion mechanism. And I am in love with it. I plan to
use it everywhere its possible. Currently its not accepting =TAB=. I
will figure that out eventually. Also I use it for flyspell as well.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :demand t
    :config (define-key helm-map (kbd "<tab>") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; rebind tab to run persistent action
    (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-i") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; make TAB work in terminal
    (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-z")  'helm-select-action) ; list actions using C-z
    )
  (use-package helm-flyspell)
#+end_src

* ORG-MODE
#+begin_quote
...
What is like the org-mode? What can make war against it?
...
#+end_quote
** Enable spell checking by default
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
#+end_src
** Enable auto-fill mode by default 
I love auto-fill mode it basically wraps the line at 80 characters for
you. So that the line is not too big and readable.
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
#+end_src
** Making the *scratch* buffer start in Org-mode
Why not?
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq initial-major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
** Enabling Org Bullets
Org-bullets look nice.
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-indent-mode)
  (use-package org-bullets)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))
#+end_src
** Enabling org-tempo
This packages allows shortcuts for source blocks etc.
#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'org-tempo)
#+end_src
* FLYCHECK
Flycheck can do a lot of stuff including,
- Showing errors in programs,
- Showing spelling errors.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package flycheck
    :ensure t
    :defer t
    :init (global-flycheck-mode))
#+end_src
* PROJECTILE 
Projectile is a project interaction library for Emacs.  It should be
noted that many projectile commands do not work if you have set âfishâ
as the âshell-file-nameâ for Emacs.  I had initially set âfishâ as the
âshell-file-nameâ in the Vterm section of this config, but oddly
enough I changed it to âbin/shâ and projectile now works as expected,
and Vterm still uses âfishâ because my default user âshâ on my Linux
system is âfishâ.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package projectile
    :config
    (projectile-mode 1))
#+end_src
* LANGUAGE SUPPORT
This section is not *really* necessary for /now/.
** code folding
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'outline-minor-mode)
#+end_src
** tree-sit
*** install language grammar
use this SRC block to install support for more languages (You can also
just call it using M-x)
#+begin_src elisp
  ;; (treesit-install-language-grammar "python")
#+end_src
** eglot
Not really much configuration was required here. I am keeping this
heading here so that I know where to put stuff in the future.
* TRANSPARENCY
With Emacs version 29, true transparency has been added.
#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha-background . 90)) ; For all new frames henceforth
#+end_src
* WHICH-KEY 
=which-key= basically shows the shortcuts you have setup. Its very
useful, because you may not which key you bonded to what.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package which-key
    :init
    (which-key-mode 1)
    :config
    (setq
     which-key-side-window-location 'bottom
     which-key-sort-order #'which-key-key-order-alpha
     which-key-sort-uppercase-first nil
     which-key-add-column-padding 1
     which-key-max-display-columns nil
     which-key-min-display-lines 6
     which-key-side-window-slot -10
     which-key-side-window-max-height 0.25
     which-key-idle-delay 0.8
     which-key-max-description-length 25
     which-key-allow-imprecise-window-fit t
     which-key-separator " â " )
    )
#+end_src
* SUDO EDIT
[[https://github.com/nflath/sudo-edit][sudo-edit]] gives us the ability to open files with sudo privileges or
switch over to editing with sudo privileges if we initially opened the
file without such privileges.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sudo-edit
    :config
    (ECFPAW/leader-keys
     "f u" '(sudo-edit-find-file :wk "Sudo find file")
     "f U" '(sudo-edit :wk "Sudo edit file")))
#+end_src

* SHELLS AND TERMINALS
You do need shell, in our editor sometimes...
** Vterm
 Vterm is a terminal emulator within Emacs.  The 'shell-file-name'
 setting sets the shell to be used in M-x shell, M-x term, M-x
 ansi-term and M-x vterm.
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (use-package vterm
     :config
     (setq shell-file-name "/bin/sh"
           vterm-max-scrollback 5000))
 #+end_src
** Vterm-Toggle 
 [[https://github.com/jixiuf/vterm-toggle][vterm-toggle]] toggles between the vterm buffer and whatever buffer you are editing.
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (use-package vterm-toggle
     :after vterm
     :config
     (setq vterm-toggle-fullscreen-p nil)
     (setq vterm-toggle-scope 'project)
     (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
                  '((lambda (buffer-or-name _)
                      (let ((buffer (get-buffer buffer-or-name)))
                        (with-current-buffer buffer
                          (or (equal major-mode 'vterm-mode)
                              (string-prefix-p vterm-buffer-name (buffer-name buffer))))))
                    (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-at-bottom)
                    ;;(display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-in-direction)

* THEME
I will just use one of the doom themes. And its called
=doom-outrun-electric=. Looks dope! Not in the TTY tho :< .
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package doom-themes
    :ensure t
    :config
    ;; Global settings (defaults)
    (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t    ; if nil, bold is universally disabled
          doom-themes-enable-italic t) ; if nil, italics is universally disabled
    (load-theme 'doom-outrun-electric t)

    ;; Enable flashing mode-line on errors
    (doom-themes-visual-bell-config)
    ;; Corrects (and improves) org-mode's native fontification.
    (doom-themes-org-config))
#+end_src

* EDIT SERVER
Edit server is an extensions which allows you edit text from your
browser in a very integrated way. Here is a [[https://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome][link]] to their git server.
