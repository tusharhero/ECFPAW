#+TITLE: ECFPAW (Emacs Configuration For Programming and Writing).

Welcome to my GNU Emacs configuration repository. You can find the
configuration [[file:config.org][here]].

I will use this configuration primarily for programming and writing
articles and stories. And it is for me, I would *discourage* you to use
my configuration. I have put it here publicly for easy access. You
might learn something if you are /completely/ new though.

Before writing this, I used to use Spacemacs, and I think spacemacs is
great too, I am going to get configure some features from spacemacs
here as well (The ones I liked obviously).

* Things I am proud of:
**  Custom Mode Line
The mode-line is fully customized(see the [[* Screenshot]]), I didn't use
any packages for it, because I didn't like the style of any of them
mode-lines. My mode line is /simpler/ than those packages, but its
honest work.
** Day and night theme switching.
I have it configured that it checks the time every hour and changes to
a appropriate theme. If its required, details in [[config.org][config]].

* Setup
I am going to use it in GNU Linux only (I hope), and here the setup is
quite simple.

I use Archlinux currently, and I have also started to use =master= git
branch.

- Get the =AUR PKGBUILD= repository,
  #+begin_src shell 
    git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/emacs-git.git
  #+end_src

- Edit the =PKGBUILD= to your liking, I use a =PGTK= build(Because I
  use Wayland as well).

- Compile and install the package,
  #+begin_src shell
    makepkg -si
  #+end_src

  /...wait.../

- Get the configuration in the right place, 
  #+begin_src shell
    git clone https://github.com/tusharhero/ECFPAW ~/.config/emacs
  #+end_src

- enable the Emacs server and start it.
  #+begin_src shell
    systemctl enable emacs --user
    systemctl start emacs --user
  #+end_src

- Run emacs using emacsclient
  #+begin_src shell
    emacsclient -nc
  #+end_src
  You can use a GUI shortcut for Emacsclient as well.

* Workarounds
I want to document some workarounds.
** KDE
For some reason, just setting up a Emacs server =systemctl= service file doesn't
let me use =emacsclient= in GUI mode.

Looking through the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/][Archwiki]], I found this [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon#h5o-17][page]] on the EmacsWiki. The
instructions on it fixed the issue for me.
