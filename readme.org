#+TITLE: ECFPAW (Emacs Configuration For Programming and Writing).

Welcome to my GNU Emacs configuration repository. You can find the
configuration [[file:config.org][here]].

I will use this configuration primarily for programming and writing
articles and stories. And it is for me, I would *discourage* you to use
my configuration. I have put it here publicly for easy access. You
might learn something if you are /completely/ new though.

Before writing this, I used to use Spacemacs, and I think spacemacs is
great too, I am going to get configure some features from spacemacs
here as well (The ones I liked obviously).

* Setup
I am going to use it in GNU Linux only (I hope), and here the setup is
quite simple.

I use Archlinux currently, and I have also started to use =master= git
branch.

- Get my =PKGBUILD= repository,
  #+begin_src shell 
    git clone https://codeberg.org/tusharhero/EPFE.git
  #+end_src

  Or if you use =SSH=,
  #+begin_src shell
    git clone git@codeberg.org:tusharhero/EPFE.git
  #+end_src

- Compile and install the package,
  #+begin_src shell
    makepkg -si
  #+end_src

  /...wait.../

- Get the configuration in the right place, 
  #+begin_src shell
    git clone https://github.com/tusharhero/ECFPAW ~/.config/emacs
  #+end_src

- /Bootstrap/ the configuration, basically I don't ship the ~init.el~,
  ~early-init.el~. I only ship the literate configuration
  ~config.org~. You need to produce the files before starting Emacs
  for the first time. I have created a script for this purpose called
  ~bootstrap-config.el~, to run it,
  #+begin_src shell
    ./bootstrap-config.el
  #+end_src
- enable the Emacs server and start it.
  #+begin_src shell
    systemctl enable emacs --user
    systemctl start emacs --user
  #+end_src

- Run emacs using emacsclient
  #+begin_src shell
    emacsclient -nc
  #+end_src
  You can use a GUI shortcut for Emacsclient as well.
